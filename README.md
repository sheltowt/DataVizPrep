Data munging for the computer vision filter data visualization

In order to provide a data set for the data visualization, I need to create datasets that contained photos of all of the #coke feed, the photos that contained the can template, and the photos that contained the logo template.  After doing that I converted the files to JSON objects that contained the attributes Greg needed.
